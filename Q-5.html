<!-- Q.5 What is the difference between Bootstrap 4 and Bootstrap 5

-- Bootstrap 4 and Bootstrap 5 are both popular versions of the Bootstrap framework, with Bootstrap 5 being the newer iteration. Here are some key differences between Bootstrap 4 and Bootstrap 5:

1). jQuery Dependency:
-- Bootstrap 4 relies on jQuery for some of its JavaScript functionalities, such as dropdowns, modals, and carousels.
-- Bootstrap 5 has removed the jQuery dependency, making it a more lightweight and modern framework. It uses vanilla JavaScript for its components, reducing the overall bundle size and improving performance.

2). Utility-First Approach:
-- Bootstrap 4 primarily uses predefined CSS classes for styling components.
-- Bootstrap 5 introduces a utility-first approach, offering more utility classes for customizing styles without the need for custom CSS. This approach gives developers greater flexibility and control over the appearance of their designs.

3). Customization:
-- Bootstrap 4 offers extensive customization options through Sass variables, allowing developers to customize various aspects of the framework, such as colors, typography, and spacing.
-- Bootstrap 5 enhances customization further by providing additional Sass variables and utility classes. It also introduces a new theme package, which enables developers to create custom themes more easily.

4). Grid System:
-- Both Bootstrap 4 and Bootstrap 5 use a 12-column grid system for creating responsive layouts.
-- Bootstrap 5 introduces a few changes to the grid system, such as adding new grid classes (col-auto, col-*, row-cols-*) and utility classes (gap-*), and improving flexbox responsiveness.

5). Documentation:
-- Bootstrap 4 documentation is extensive and well-organized, providing detailed information on using components, layout options, and customization.
-- Bootstrap 5 documentation builds upon Bootstrap 4's documentation, offering updated and expanded content to reflect the changes and improvements introduced in Bootstrap 5.

6). New Components and Features:
-- Bootstrap 5 introduces several new components and features, such as offcanvas navigation, improved form validation styles, and updated icons (replaced Glyphicons with SVG icons from Bootstrap Icons).
-- Some components and features have been deprecated or removed in Bootstrap 5, such as the card deck and card group components, and the Input Group Addons.

7). Accessibility:
-- Bootstrap 5 places a stronger emphasis on accessibility, with improved keyboard navigation and focus styles, better color contrast, and enhanced ARIA attributes.
-- While Bootstrap 4 also supports accessibility features, Bootstrap 5 enhances accessibility further by addressing some of the shortcomings found in the previous version.

-- Overall, Bootstrap 5 builds upon the strengths of Bootstrap 4 while introducing new features, improvements, and a modernized approach to web development. Developers transitioning from Bootstrap 4 to Bootstrap 5 can expect a more streamlined experience, improved performance, and greater flexibility in styling and customization. -->
