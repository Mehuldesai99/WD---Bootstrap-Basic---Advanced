<!-- Q.1 What are the advantages of Bootstrap? 


-- Bootstrap is a popular front-end framework for developing responsive and mobile-first websites. It offers several advantages:

1). Responsive Design: Bootstrap provides a responsive grid system and predefined classes for creating responsive layouts that adapt to various screen sizes. This ensures that your website looks good and functions well on devices of all sizes, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones.

2). Consistency: Bootstrap offers a consistent and uniform design language with predefined components like buttons, forms, navigation bars, and typography. This consistency helps maintain a cohesive look and feel across different parts of your website, enhancing user experience.

3). Save Time: Bootstrap comes with a wide range of pre-built components and styles, which significantly speeds up the development process. Developers can leverage ready-made templates, themes, and UI components to quickly prototype and build websites without having to start from scratch.

4). Cross-browser Compatibility: Bootstrap is designed to work seamlessly across different web browsers, ensuring consistent rendering and functionality. This eliminates the need for extensive browser testing and helps reduce compatibility issues.

5). Customizable: While Bootstrap provides a set of default styles and components, it's highly customizable. Developers can easily customize Bootstrap's variables, mixins, and components to match their project's specific design requirements. This flexibility allows for creating unique and visually appealing websites.

6). Community and Documentation: Bootstrap has a vast community of developers contributing to its ecosystem. This means there are plenty of resources, tutorials, plugins, and third-party integrations available to help developers solve problems and extend Bootstrap's functionality. Additionally, Bootstrap's official documentation is comprehensive and well-maintained, making it easy for developers to find answers and learn new features.

7). Support for Accessibility: Bootstrap prioritizes accessibility by following best practices and providing features like ARIA labels and keyboard navigation support out of the box. This ensures that websites built with Bootstrap are accessible to users with disabilities, complying with web accessibility standards.

8). Scalability: Whether you're building a simple landing page or a complex web application, Bootstrap scales effectively to meet the needs of projects of all sizes. Its modular and component-based architecture allows developers to manage and scale their codebase efficiently as the project grows. -->
