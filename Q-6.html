<!-- Q.6 What is a Button Group, and what is the class for a basic Button Group?

-- A Button Group in Bootstrap is a group of buttons that are visually grouped together, typically sharing the same style and alignment. Button groups are commonly used to organize related buttons and present them as a cohesive unit within a user interface.

-- The class for a basic Button Group in Bootstrap is .btn-group. Here's how a basic Button Group is structured:

<div class="btn-group" role="group" aria-label="Basic example">
    <button type="button" class="btn btn-primary">Button 1</button>
    <button type="button" class="btn btn-primary">Button 2</button>
    <button type="button" class="btn btn-primary">Button 3</button>
  </div>

-- In this example:

-- The <div> element with the class btn-group acts as the container for the button group.
-- Each <button> element within the btn-group container represents an individual button in the group.
-- The role="group" attribute is added for accessibility purposes to indicate that the <div> serves as a group of buttons.
-- The aria-label attribute provides a label for assistive technologies to describe the purpose of the button group.

-- By using the .btn-group class, the buttons within the group are visually styled to appear as a cohesive unit, with appropriate spacing and alignment. Additionally, Bootstrap provides variations of button groups, such as vertical button groups (btn-group-vertical) and button toolbar (btn-toolbar), to accommodate different layout needs. -->
