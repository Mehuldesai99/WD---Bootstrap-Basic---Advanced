<!-- Q.3 What are the default Bootstrap text settings?

-- Bootstrap provides default text settings through its typography utilities. These utilities offer a set of predefined classes that can be applied to text elements to control their appearance, including font size, font weight, line height, and text alignment. Here are the default Bootstrap text settings:

1). Font Size: Bootstrap offers a range of classes to control the font size of text elements. The default font sizes are defined using the following classes:
-- .h1, .h2, .h3, .h4, .h5, .h6: Heading classes for various levels of headings, with decreasing font sizes from .h1 to .h6.
-- .lead: Increases the font size of text to make it stand out, typically used for introductory paragraphs.

2). Font Weight: Bootstrap provides classes to adjust the font weight of text elements:
-- .font-weight-bold: Sets the font weight to bold.
-- .font-weight-normal: Sets the font weight to normal (typically equivalent to 400).

3). Line Height: Bootstrap offers classes to adjust the line height of text elements:
-- .lh-1, .lh-sm: Sets a tight line height.
-- .lh-base: Sets the default line height.
-- .lh-lg: Sets a loose line height.

4). Text Alignment: Bootstrap provides classes to control the alignment of text:
-- .text-left: Aligns text to the left.
-- .text-center: Centers text horizontally.
-- .text-right: Aligns text to the right.
-- .text-justify: Justifies text, aligning it flush with both the left and right margins.
-- .text-nowrap: Prevents text from wrapping onto multiple lines, forcing it to remain on a single line.

5). Text Transformation: Bootstrap includes classes for text transformation:
-- .text-uppercase: Converts text to uppercase.
-- .text-lowercase: Converts text to lowercase.
-- .text-capitalize: Capitalizes the first letter of each word in the text.

-- By applying these classes to HTML elements, developers can easily style text according to Bootstrap's default settings, ensuring consistency and readability across the website. These utilities are customizable, allowing developers to override the default settings as needed to match the design requirements of their projects. -->
