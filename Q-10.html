<!-- Q.10 What is a bootstrap card and how would you create one?

-- A Bootstrap card is a flexible and extensible content container that allows you to display various types of content, such as text, images, links, buttons, and more, in a visually appealing and structured manner. Cards are versatile components commonly used in website layouts to showcase individual pieces of content or group related information together.

-- To create a Bootstrap card, you can use the .card class along with other optional classes to customize its appearance and content. Here's a basic example of how to create a simple Bootstrap card: -->


<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <title>Bootstrap Card</title>
  <!-- Bootstrap CSS -->
  <link href="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.5.2/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet">
</head>
<body>

<div class="container">
  <h2>Bootstrap Card</h2>

  <!-- Basic Card -->
  <div class="card">
    <div class="card-body">
      <h5 class="card-title">Card Title</h5>
      <p class="card-text">Some quick example text to build on the card title and make up the bulk of the card's content.</p>
      <a href="#" class="btn btn-primary">Go somewhere</a>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<!-- Bootstrap JS (Optional) -->
<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.5.1.slim.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@popperjs/core@2.5.3/dist/umd/popper.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.5.2/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script>
</body>
</html>


<!-- -- In this example:

-- The .card class is used to define the card container.
-- Inside the card, the .card-body class is used to contain the main content of the card.
-- Within the .card-body, you can include various elements such as headings (<h5> in this example), paragraphs (<p>), buttons (<a> with .btn classes), images, and more to create the desired content within the card.

-- You can further customize the card by adding additional classes provided by Bootstrap, such as .card-header, .card-footer, .card-img-top, .card-header, .card-footer, and more, to style different parts of the card or enhance its functionality. Additionally, Bootstrap 4 also offers responsive variants such as .card-columns for creating card layouts with multiple cards arranged in columns. -->
