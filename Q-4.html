<!-- Q.4 What do you know about the Bootstrap Grid System?

-- The Bootstrap Grid System is a powerful layout system provided by the Bootstrap framework, designed to create responsive and mobile-first web layouts. It is based on a 12-column grid layout, which allows developers to easily create complex page layouts by dividing the available space into columns and rows.

-- Key features of the Bootstrap Grid System include:

1). Responsive Design: The grid system is inherently responsive, meaning it automatically adjusts to fit different screen sizes and devices. This responsiveness is achieved by using percentage-based widths for columns, ensuring that they scale proportionally to the viewport width.

2). 12-column Layout: The grid system is divided into 12 equal-width columns, providing a flexible foundation for creating a variety of layouts. Developers can choose how many columns to use for different screen sizes, allowing for precise control over the layout's structure and design.

3). Container and Container-fluid: The grid system is contained within either a fixed-width container (container) or a full-width fluid container (container-fluid). These containers provide horizontal padding and ensure that the grid layout remains centered and visually appealing across different screen sizes.

4). Column Classes: Bootstrap provides a set of predefined classes to create columns of different widths within the grid system. These classes, such as col-, col-sm-, col-md-, col-lg-, and col-xl-, define the width of columns at various breakpoints (extra small, small, medium, large, and extra-large), allowing for responsive layouts that adapt to different devices.

5). Offset and Nesting: In addition to columns, Bootstrap supports offsetting columns and nesting them within one another. Offset classes (offset-) allow developers to create space between columns, while nesting columns enables the creation of more complex and hierarchical layouts.

6). Alignment and Ordering: Bootstrap provides classes to control the alignment and ordering of columns within rows. Developers can align columns horizontally using classes such as justify-content-start, justify-content-center, justify-content-end, and justify-content-around. They can also change the order of columns using classes such as order-first and order-last.

7). Gutters: Bootstrap includes gutter classes (gutter-) to control the spacing between columns. By default, columns have gutters on both sides, but developers can use gutter classes to adjust or remove the spacing as needed.

-- Overall, the Bootstrap Grid System simplifies the process of creating responsive and visually appealing web layouts by providing a flexible and customizable grid structure. It offers a wide range of features and options for creating complex layouts that work seamlessly across different devices and screen sizes. -->
